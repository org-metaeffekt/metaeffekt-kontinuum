# metaeffekt-kontinuum

The {metaeffekt} Kontinuum repository aggregates baseline configurations to support using the 
{metaeffekt} plugins, tools and content.

## Processors

To enable broad adoption the Kontinuum uses Maven as integration level. Yet, for specific tasks, isolated
task definitions are provided as individual .xml files in the `processors` folder. Every .xml files defines
a process step in analogy to an isolated workflow engine task.

On integration level the processors can be combined to define pipelines and workflows.

For further details see [Processors](processors/README.md).
