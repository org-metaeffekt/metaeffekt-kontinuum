# Workspace 002

## Sample Product 1.0.0

This workspace configuration is artificial. It does not start with an SBOM or a software artifact but skips the
extraction process. This workspace shows a continuous workflow where each phase is reliant on its predecessors. This
reflects real-world examples more closely than the workspace-001.
