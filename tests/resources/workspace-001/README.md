# Workspace 001

## Sample Product 1.0.0

This workspace configuration is artificial. It does not start with an SBOM or a software artifact but skips the
extraction process. This workspace merely provides a structure in which results will be produced. The results in each 
phase are not dependent on the previous phase as would usually be the case, as this workspace is simply intended to 
test each processor on its own, with no regard for a continuous workflow.
