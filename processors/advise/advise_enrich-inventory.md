# Advise - Enrich Inventories

This process takes an input inventory and enriches it with vulnerability information. Additional configurations can influence
the information contained in the resulting inventory such as which vulnerability databases should be used, custom vulnerabilities and
many more, listed in the table below.

## Properties

The different properties are sorted into three different groups which are explained in the top level [README](../README.md#processor-conventions)
of this repository.

### Input / Output
| Parameter                        | Required | Description                                                               |

| input.inventory.file             | yes      | The input inventory file which will be enriched.                          |
| input.vulnerabilities.custom.dir | no       | The directory for custom vulnerabilities that can be added to enrichment. |
| output.inventory.file            | yes      | The file of the resulting output inventory.                               |

| param.context.dir              | yes      | The directory containing the vulnerability context information.           |
| param.security.policy.file     | yes      | The security policy file to use.                                          |
| param.activate.*                  | no       | Switches determining which vulnerability databases are utilized during the enrichment process. |
| param.exclude.nvd.equivalent.*    | no       | Switches determining if vulnerabilities equivalent to those found via nvd should be excluded.  |
| param.dashboard.title             | ignore   | Title for a dashboard which could be generated during this process.                            |
